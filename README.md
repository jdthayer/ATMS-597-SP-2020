This python module converts temperatures interchangeably between degrees Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin using object-oriented programming. Single temperature inputs can be of type string, integer, or float while multiple temperature inputs can be of either type list or numpy array. Converted temperature values are output as type float. 

The program is compatible with both Python 2 and 3, only requiring importing of the numpy package. Conversion to other temperature scales (e.g., Rankine, Newton, etc.) is not supported.
