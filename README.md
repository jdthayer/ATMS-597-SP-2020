This python module converts temperatures interchangeably between degrees Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin using object-oriented programming. Single temperature inputs can be an integer or float and from either a list or numpy array. Multiple temperature inputs can be a list or numpy array. Converted temperature values are output in the same type they were input (i.e., output as a list if input as a list; output as a numpy array if input as a numpy array). String inputs are not supported. 

The module contains an attribute 'print_nice_output' for organized printing of converted temperatures for easy visualization. Examples of code functionality for a single input, list of temperatures, and an array of temperatures are also included.

The program is compatible with both Python 2 and 3, only requiring importing of the numpy package. Conversion to other temperature scales (e.g., Rankine, Newton, etc.) is not supported.
